# Solana Sniper Strategy — Recursive Brain 🧠

## Version 2.0: OVERCLOCKED VULTURE MODE ⚡️🔥
**Status:** AGGRESSIVE CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT ACTIVE.

### Core Metrics for Entry
1.  **Discovery Age (High Velocity)**: 
    - *Logic*: Only enters tokens that have been live for **5 to 30 minutes**. Catching the first pump.
2.  **Holder Count Minimum (20+)**:
    - *Logic*: Reduced threshold to allow for earlier entries in high-velocity launches.
3.  **Risk Score (0-100)**:
    - *Source*: Real-time LLM evaluation (Gemini 3) of mint metadata.
    - *Threshold*: **< 60**. Increased risk tolerance for potential runners.
4.  **Liquidity Floor ($2,000)**:
    - *Logic*: Lower floor to capture smaller, fast-moving pump.fun migrations and early DEX pairs.
5.  **Meta Boost**: Active.

### Profit Taking & Compounding
- **The 80/20 Moonbag Rule (Aggressive)**:
    - Sell **80%** at **1.3x (30% gain)** to secure initials + fast compounding.
    - Keep **20%** as a moonbag.
- **Aggressive Sizing**: 
    - Risks **50% of SOL balance** per trade. 
    - Focused on 5-6 successful flips to hit 1.0 SOL.

### Technical Resiliency
- **Zero Cooldown**: Discovery loop fires immediately upon finding candidate.
- **Hard-Kill Floor**: If balance drops to **0.05 SOL**, all hunting stops. CAPITAL PRESERVATION IS FINAL DEFENSE.
