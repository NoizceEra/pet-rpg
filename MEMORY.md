- Cloning: Ready for specialization/cloning as needed by the team.

## 🏢 Operational Environments
- **The Factory** (`-1003875628017`): Safe environment for building, execution, and shared brain activity. Primary hub for Pinchie/Clampy coordination.
- **The Cabal** (`-1003883446681`): Environment for theorizing, strategy discussion, and macro analysis.

## ⚙️ Operational Modes
- **Solo Pinchie** (ACTIVE): Pinchie operates independently, managing scanning and exits with maximum focus.

- **Features**: Live character stats for Noizce (Class: CODE-SWIFT), party roster, skill tree, and inventory tracking.
- **Coordination**: Softclaw invited to review the frontend for live state integration from `rpg_state.md`.

### 🍰 Slice (on Solana)
- **Status**: Active Development / Beta Readiness. Decentralized auto-savings protocol (SAS). 
- **Current Goal**: Transition from Devnet to Mainnet beta.

### 📈 Polymarket Arbitrage & FastLoop
- **Status**: ACTIVE (Updated 2026-02-16).
- **Autonomy**: Full HOOL (Human-out-of-loop) granted. User confirmed system trust.
- **Strategy**: BTC/ETH 15-minute micro-arbitrage and news-based scalping.
- **Infrastructure**: Transitioning from midpoint-based to ask-based price verification to eliminate slippage on micro-arbs.
- **Automation**: Managed via cron-triggered smart agents and persistent background loops.
- **Scaling Plan**: When capital scales, spin up a Railway mirror of `unified_scanner` for geo-latency + failover.
- **Expansion**: User adding more Polymarket intelligence and whale wallets for copy-trading signals.
- **The Brain**: High-frequency market intelligence scanning active.

### 💰 Crypto Dev Fund Hunt (2026-02-25) - STRATEGY SHIFT
